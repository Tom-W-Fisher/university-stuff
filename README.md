# university-stuff

This is a public repo for all the code I'm writing as part of my university course. I haven't specified a license for it, I don't know what that means. Probably the code is poor quality anyway.

For some reason when I first made commits, it shows as being done by some guy called "Thomas Strafrac". I have no idea who that person is. It appears he is in France. He has not contributed to this repo.
